#Get Started

This section explains how to set up your Arduino to run with Virtual Shields for Arduino!

#Setup for Windows Virtual Shields for Arduino (Arduino and PC)

##Hardware

###What you need
 1. Arduino Uno or compatible device.
 2. Bluetooth module - we recommend the [SparkFun BlueSMiRF Silver](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12577){:target="_blank"}.
 3. Connecting wires.
 4. A computer to upload your Arduino sketches.

###Set up your Arduino
 1. Prepare the Bluetooth module if necessary (the Bluetooth module may need to have headers soldered onto it).
 2. Except for the one difference noted below, connect the Bluetooth module to the Arduino per the wiring diagram ([BlueSMiRF wiring diagram](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/using-the-bluesmirf/hardware-hookup){:target="_blank"}).

		DIFFERENCE: Use pins 0 and 1 instead of 2 and 3:
		The Bluetooth TX should connect to pin 0 (Arduino RX or RX0).
		The Bluetooth RX should connect to pin 1 (Arduino TX or TX0).

##Software

###What you need
 1. Arduino IDE 1.6 or better.
 2. ArduinoJson library.
 3. This [repository](https://github.com/ms-iot/virtual-shields-arduino){:target="_blank"}, which contains the example sketch which will run on the Arduino.

###Set up your Arduino IDE
 1. Download and install the [Arduino IDE](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software){:target="_blank"}.  Launch the program.
 2. Verify that you have the correct Arduino board selected under *Tools > Board*.
 3. Verify that you have the correct COM Port selected under *Tools > Port*.  The name of the board should appear next to each option, making it much easier to choose the correct option.

###Set up ArduinoJson library
 1. From the [ArduinoJson repository](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson){:target="_blank"}, clone the repository or download the zip.
 2. Place the whole repository into your libraries folder (i.e. Documents\Arduino\libraries\ArduinoJson\).

###Set up this repository
 1. Clone this [repository](https://github.com/ms-iot/virtual-shields-arduino){:target="_blank"} or download the ZIP.  If you're not familiar with git and want to do a proper clone, follow the instructions [here] (https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/){:target="_blank"}.
 2. Copy the "VirtualShield" folder, found in the "Arduino\Libraries" folder of the repository you just downloaded, to your Arduino library folder (i.e. Documents\Arduino\libraries\VirtualShield\).

###Test your setup
 1. From the Arduino IDE, go to the menu item File->Examples->Virtual Shields->HelloWorld-Speech-Eventing. This should load the speech-recognition based Hello Blinky example we're using for this tutorial.
 2. Before uploading the sketch to your Arduino, temporarily remove the Bluetooth TX and RX wires from the Arduino (there is only one serial port shared between the USB and Bluetooth - the Bluetooth interferes with the upload).
 3. Upload the sketch by pressing the "Upload" button in the IDE.
 4. Replace the Bluetooth TX and RX wires into the Arduino pins (Bluetooth TX to Arduino RX (or RX0) and Bluetooth RX to Arduino TX or (TX0)).
 5. On the phone, pair to the Bluetooth device on your Arduino in the Bluetooth settings. If you're using the BlueSMiRF, the default pin code is 1234. NOTE: The red blinking light on the BlueSMiRF continues to blink red after a successful pairing. This is expected. It only turns green after a connecting with the application.
 6. Open the Virtual Shields for Arduino app on your Windows Phone (or other Windows 10 device) and view the main screen. 
 7. Press the Reset button on your Arduino.
 5. You should see or hear a hello message on the Virtual Shields for Arduino application running on your Windows Phone.
