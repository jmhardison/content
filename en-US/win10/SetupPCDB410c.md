## Install the DragonBoard update Tool

1. Download the DragonBoard Update Tool by selecting the download link appropriate for your PC: [x86](https://developer.qualcomm.com/download/db410c/windows-10-iot-update-tool-dragonboard-410c-x86.zip) or [x64](https://developer.qualcomm.com/download/db410c/windows-10-iot-update-tool-dragonboard-410c-x64.zip)

2. Right click on the downloaded zip file and select extract all. This will create a new folder with the same name as the downloaded zip file.

5. The installer will create a shortcut to the DragonBoard Update Tool on your desktop and in your start menu, under Qualcomm->DragonBoardUpdate Tool.



## Download the DragonBoard Win10 IoT Core Image

1. Download a Windows 10 IoT Core image from our [downloads page](http://ms-iot.github.io/content/en-US/Downloads.htm){:target="_blank"}.
 
2. Double click the downloaded ISO file. This will automatically mount the ISO as a new virtual CD-drive. 
(Look for a new CD-ROM drive)

3. The mounted virtual drive contains an installer file “Windows_10_IoT_Core_QCDB410C.msi”. Double click the file to start the installation.

    The installer creates a new directory: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft IoT\FFU\QCDB410C\ which contains the DragonBoard410c image file “flash.ffu”.

    Unlike Raspberry Pi 2 and Minnowboard Max, we will not be applying this FFU to an SD card. Instead, we will use this flash file on the next page.

4. Eject the virtual CD-drive when done.
