###For Raspberry Pi 2 (RPi2)

1. Connect the shorter leg of the LED to GPIO 5 (pin 29 on the expansion header) on the RPi2.
2. Connect the longer leg of the LED to the resistor.
3. Connect the other end of the resistor to one of the 3.3V pins on the RPi2.
4. Note that the polarity of the LED is important. (This configuration is commonly known as Active Low)

And here is the pinout of the RPi2:
