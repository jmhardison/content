##Windows IoT Lightning Performance Testing

The GPIO performance was tested for Windows IoT Lightning functionality using a simple GPIO toggle app. 
The tests were performed by toggling GPIO 5 between 0 and 1 at the fastest possible speed. The toggle frequency for each case was measured using a Tektronix TDS 2012C Oscilloscope. The following results were obtained from the analysis:
